                <p>The forks here are what connect the front wheel to the handlebars (top of the frame). They are connected through metal tubes with springs inside of them. The black rippled covers are Dust Covers to protect everything inside. Common forms of forks are filled with Fork fluid and even Air!

The placement of a Carb (for short) is typically connected to the back of the engine, under the seat and gas tank. Carbs are found on older motorcycles, before 2000's

                <p>Movement</p>
                <p>The chain on a motorcycle is located on the rear wheel on either side. It's connected to a gear on the motor that spins. The faster you want to go, the faster the chain will spin the rear wheel forward. These require high maintenance and should be cleaned and lubed often.

                <p>Brakes, like a car, are the same. One or two calipers may be on each wheel depending on what motorcycle you are looking at. These compress a disc when you engage the brake and the friction on the brake pads slow you down.

                <h1>Engine Fins</h1>
                <p>Cooling the Temperature</p>
                <p>Older bikes commonly have an "Aircooled Engine" which inhereit these fins. When the bike is in motion, air rushes through these fins to help disperse teh heat out of the engine. Theoretically you could leave the bike parked and running adn the bike would overheat but it's very unlikely.
